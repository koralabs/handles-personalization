# User Actions Checklist (Feature Blockers Only)

Purpose:
- List only actions/inputs the user must perform or provide because the agent cannot do them.
- Include setup/provision/enable steps only when they are required for a feature to work.
- Do not include routine verification/check tasks or optional improvements.

## Core Runtime

- Provision and fund the production script address for the selected network using `contract/aiken.spend.addr_mainnet`; blocker reason: on-chain cutover cannot happen without a funded target script address.
- Submit/refresh `bg_policy_ids` and `pfp_policy_ids` reference UTxOs with `PolicyIndexRoot` datums and required identity tokens; blocker reason: MPF policy approval checks fail without migrated root UTxOs.

## Conditional Features

- Roll out proof-service support that emits `__bg_proof` and `__pfp_proof` under `designer`; blocker reason: PERSONALIZE approvals for non-empty BG/PFP assets reject when proofs are absent.

## Updater Features

- No user-owned setup blockers currently identified for updater-specific paths.

## Deploy / Infra Features

- Configure production transaction builders/backends to target Aiken `*.spend` hash/address artifacts generated by `npm run compile:aiken`; blocker reason: clients cannot route PERSONALIZE/MIGRATE/REVOKE/UPDATE/RETURN_TO_SENDER to Aiken without hash/address cutover.
- Keep an operator-controlled rollback flag that can route traffic back to Helios during rollout window; blocker reason: safe rollback cannot be executed instantly without a runtime switch.
